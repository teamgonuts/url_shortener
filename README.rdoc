UrlShortener is an application created as a fun way for Carl and I to learn rails.

It contains all the basic functionality of a usual URL shortener with one twist: the code created for each website is a combination of two curse words banned by Google's 'What do you Love?' service. 

Note: This application was created for our own amusement and is not intended to offended.
